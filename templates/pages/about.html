            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our bookstore was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to connect readers with books available in their local area. 
                What started as a small passion project has grown into a platform that serves book lovers across the country.
            </p>

                in their city, making it easier to find and purchase the books they love.
